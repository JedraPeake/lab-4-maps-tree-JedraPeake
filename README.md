## Q1.Implement an AVL Tree

#### What is the benefit of an AVL tree over a traditional Binary Search Tree?
An AVL tree is self balancing so the insert/remove and lookup are a O(logn) instead of O(n) time.
#### Red-Black trees were covered in class, explain what the benefits of the Red-Black tree over an AVL tree.
The difference is that RB-Trees guarantee O(1) rotations per insert operation.
